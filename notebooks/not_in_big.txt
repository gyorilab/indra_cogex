Calyciferous axons were highly consistent across species , projecting directly from the cochlear nucleus , across the midline in the trapezoid body , to the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body .
The distribution and morphology of axons projecting from the medial superior olivary nucleus to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus were studied in the adult cat .
We studied the tangential organization of neurons projecting from primary visual cortex ( V1 ) to the middle temporal visual area ( MT ) and their relationship to the CO blobs .
Medial olivocochlear ( MOC ) neurons project from the brain to the cochlea to form the efferent limb of the MOC reflex .
Axons projecting from higher order to early visual areas may contribute to extraperceptual , complex processes within area V1 , such as activation in response to visual imagery , and are a possible substrate for synchronous linkage of spatially discrete assemblies of neurons .
