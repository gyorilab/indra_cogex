In these experiments we have asked whether the projection from the rat 's primary visual cortex , area 17 , to the extrastriate visual cortical area 18a is formed in a sequence and whether that sequence resembles the pattern of inside-out cortical neurogenesis .
The projection from area 18 also extended throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus , but was sparser and less uniformly distributed than that from area 17 .
Therefore , some cells of Dogiel project to the tectum normally , but only from the central retina .
The major conclusion from the present study is that in larval lamprey , some new brain-spinal cord projections are added with age that could be due to axonal elongation by preexisting brain neurons and/or descending projections from new neurons ( i.e ., neurogenesis or maturation of incompletely differentiated neurons ) .
The second gustatory nucleus of teleost fishes receives ascending fibers from the primary gustatory center in the medulla and sends efferent fibers to several nuclei in the inferior lobe of the diencephalon .
Our chief aim in this study was to examine and compare the synaptic arrangements and neurochemistry of elements involving direct lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) input from the K pathway with those involving indirect LGN input from the M and P pathways arriving from cortical layer IV .
Finally , ascending serotoninergic projections from the raphe nuclei appear to terminate principally in the lateral part of the MPN , whereas inputs from regions containing noradrenergic cell groups are chiefly distributed to the central and medial parts of the nucleus .

Only the projection from the A laminae of the LGN was found to approximate a point-to-point projection with a convergence of 0.4 mm and 2 mm in divergence .
In these experiments we have asked whether the projection from the rat 's primary visual cortex , area 17 , to the extrastriate visual cortical area 18a is formed in a sequence and whether that sequence resembles the pattern of inside-out cortical neurogenesis .
The projection from area 18 also extended throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus , but was sparser and less uniformly distributed than that from area 17 .

This distribution fits well with published data on the somatotopy of the corticopontine projection from the rat primary somatosensory cortex .
In contrast , the projection from the encapsulated part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis appears to end preferentially in the central part of the MPN and in immediately adjacent regions of the medial subdivision .
A projection from area 19 to laminae C1 , C2 and C3 was also demonstrated autoradiographically .
The projections of the basal / accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei to MD and to prefrontal cortex , and from MD to amygdaloceptive parts of prefrontal cortex , are not as tightly organized .

Only the projection from the A laminae of the LGN was found to approximate a point-to-point projection with a convergence of 0.4 mm and 2 mm in divergence .
In these experiments we have asked whether the projection from the rat 's primary visual cortex , area 17 , to the extrastriate visual cortical area 18a is formed in a sequence and whether that sequence resembles the pattern of inside-out cortical neurogenesis .
The projection from area 18 also extended throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus , but was sparser and less uniformly distributed than that from area 17 .
Therefore , some cells of Dogiel project to the tectum normally , but only from the central retina .
The major conclusion from the present study is that in larval lamprey , some new brain-spinal cord projections are added with age that could be due to axonal elongation by preexisting brain neurons and/or descending projections from new neurons ( i.e ., neurogenesis or maturation of incompletely differentiated neurons ) .
The second gustatory nucleus of teleost fishes receives ascending fibers from the primary gustatory center in the medulla and sends efferent fibers to several nuclei in the inferior lobe of the diencephalon .

One type of neuron , which has been shown in other studies to produce compound action potentials whose frequency varies with a circadian rhythm , is also found only ventral to the optic nerve head and associated axon bundles .
In the 3b forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation , a decrease in density of ChAT positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks , involving all cortical layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector , but the loss of ChAT immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk .
Spinal hemisection reduced immunostaining of the ipsilateral dorsal columns in segments rostral to the lesion and in the dorsal column nuclei , presumably from the loss of ascending Abeta afferents , but there was no change caudal to the lesion .

Secondary vestibular cholinergic projection to the cerebellum of rabbit and rat as revealed by choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry , retrograde and orthograde tracers .
The normal olivocerebellar projection is exclusively contralateral and the climbing fiber projection to the paramedian vermis splits P1+ down the middle , implying that it consists of two adjacent mabQ113+ bands not separated by mabQ113-territory .
The magnocellular division of the medial geniculate , a thalamic auditory ( and , to a moderate degree , a spinothalamic ) relay , sent heavy projections to the central , accessory basal , lateral , and anterior cortical nuclei , and to the anterior amygdaloid area and the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract .
The contributions of glial guidance , diffuse exploratory outgrowth , and target produced trophic factors to the formation of an initially exuberant projection to the island are discussed .
This region ( neostriatum frontale , pars trigeminale : NFT ) gives rise to the fronto-archistriate tract which terminates both in the archistriatum intermedium and in the overlying neostriatum caudale , medial to the ventricle ( neostriatum caudale , pars trigeminale : NCT ) .

The earliest 5-HT-containing cells at E4 appear rostral to the pontine flexure , yet by E5 , 5-HT neuronal groups are observed throughout the brainstem from just caudal to the mesencephalic flexure to the cervical flexure .
These changes may contribute to mechanisms rostral to the site of SCI that trigger and maintain neuropathic pain .
One type of neuron , which has been shown in other studies to produce compound action potentials whose frequency varies with a circadian rhythm , is also found only ventral to the optic nerve head and associated axon bundles .
In the 3b forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation , a decrease in density of ChAT positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks , involving all cortical layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector , but the loss of ChAT immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk .
Spinal hemisection reduced immunostaining of the ipsilateral dorsal columns in segments rostral to the lesion and in the dorsal column nuclei , presumably from the loss of ascending Abeta afferents , but there was no change caudal to the lesion .

In rats with iontophoretic tracer injections in this nucleus , many labeled neurons were detected near the injection site , especially ventral and caudal to it .
To identify structural changes that could initiate or maintain SCI pain , we used a complete transection model in rats to examine how structural remodeling in the dorsal horn rostral to the lesion relates to distance from injury , laminar region , and duration of injury .
Sprouting of peptidergic nociceptive and descending supraspinal projections to the dorsal horn following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) has been proposed as a mechanism of neuropathic pain .

To identify structural changes that could initiate or maintain SCI pain , we used a complete transection model in rats to examine how structural remodeling in the dorsal horn rostral to the lesion relates to distance from injury , laminar region , and duration of injury .
Sprouting of peptidergic nociceptive and descending supraspinal projections to the dorsal horn following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) has been proposed as a mechanism of neuropathic pain .
The other three receptor types are restricted to the region ventral to the optic nerve head .
It is likely that the climbing fiber projection to the cerebellar cortex and the distribution of the two Purkinje cell phenotypes share a common compartmental organization .

The projection of the medial and posterior articular nerves of the cat 's knee to the spinal cord .
The pattern of contralateral retinal projection to the nucleus of the optic tract and posterior pretectal nucleus in mutants was indistinguishable from that seen in the normal wild-type mice .
The projections of the basal / accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei to MD and to prefrontal cortex , and from MD to amygdaloceptive parts of prefrontal cortex , are not as tightly organized .

Development of projections from auditory to visual areas in the cat .
Secondary vestibular cholinergic projection to the cerebellum of rabbit and rat as revealed by choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry , retrograde and orthograde tracers .
The latter two nuclei project to separate regions which in turn project to the electroreceptive lateral line lobe .
The normal olivocerebellar projection is exclusively contralateral and the climbing fiber projection to the paramedian vermis splits P1+ down the middle , implying that it consists of two adjacent mabQ113+ bands not separated by mabQ113-territory .
The magnocellular division of the medial geniculate , a thalamic auditory ( and , to a moderate degree , a spinothalamic ) relay , sent heavy projections to the central , accessory basal , lateral , and anterior cortical nuclei , and to the anterior amygdaloid area and the nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract .
The contributions of glial guidance , diffuse exploratory outgrowth , and target produced trophic factors to the formation of an initially exuberant projection to the island are discussed .
This region ( neostriatum frontale , pars trigeminale : NFT ) gives rise to the fronto-archistriate tract which terminates both in the archistriatum intermedium and in the overlying neostriatum caudale , medial to the ventricle ( neostriatum caudale , pars trigeminale : NCT ) .
The earliest 5-HT-containing cells at E4 appear rostral to the pontine flexure , yet by E5 , 5-HT neuronal groups are observed throughout the brainstem from just caudal to the mesencephalic flexure to the cervical flexure .
These changes may contribute to mechanisms rostral to the site of SCI that trigger and maintain neuropathic pain .
One type of neuron , which has been shown in other studies to produce compound action potentials whose frequency varies with a circadian rhythm , is also found only ventral to the optic nerve head and associated axon bundles .
In the 3b forelimb sector contralateral to the deafferentation , a decrease in density of ChAT positive fibers relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 2 weeks and most pronounced at 13 weeks , involving all cortical layers except layer I. There was no such decrease in the hindlimb sector , but the loss of ChAT immunoreactivity extended to sectors representing proximal forelimb and trunk .
