{% block lead %}
    This application performs kinase over-representation analysis to identify kinases that are
    statistically enriched in a set of phosphosites based on known kinase-substrate relationships.<br>
    <small>
        The analysis uses phosphorylation data from the INDRA database to identify upstream kinases
        that are likely responsible for the phosphorylation patterns in your dataset.
