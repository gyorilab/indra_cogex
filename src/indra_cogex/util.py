    # database:
    # 1. Can the loaded statement reproduce the original matches hash of the
    #    raw statement json with stmt.get_hash(refresh=True) after being
    #    initialized via `indra.statements.io.stmt_from_json`?
    # 2. Does json.loads error?
    # Denoting a matching hash as T or F for matching or not, and an error
    # as 'error' the following table is observed:
    #
    # | # | json.loads       | cleanup + json.loads | pick                 |
    # |   | > stmt_from_json | > stmt_from_json     |                      |
    # |---|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
    # | 1 | T                | T                    | cleanup + json.loads |
    # | 2 | F                | T                    | cleanup + json.loads |
    # | 3 | error            | T                    | cleanup + json.loads |

    # cleanup and once with cleanup, to check both conditions before
    # returning the correct json object.

    # of >75 M raw statements). On inspection, none of these had any escaped
