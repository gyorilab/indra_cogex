The two datasets I am using are ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer . The details of those are as follows:

## Dataset 1: (Ovarian cancer)

File: OV_ruth_1.csv


1        what instrument was used to make it / what methodology was used:
            SRM
            TSQ Vantage,QTRAP 5500,4000 QTRAP
2        who made the data/what’s their affiliation
Ruth Hüttenhain, Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6731088/
3        what was the original goal of the data
            To develop SRM-based strategy for developing plasma-based protein biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer

## Dataset 2: (Colorectal cancer)

File: CRC_silvia_1.xlsx

1. what instrument was used to make it / what methodology was used:
   SRM
2  who made the data/what’s their affiliation:
            Silvia Surinova, Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland
            https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.201404873
3        what was the original goal of the data
            Biomarker development for epithelial ovarian cancer
4        what’s the goal of the project you’re doing
            I am trying to generate realistic mass spec based quantitative proteomics data using generative models. I want a prior knowledge network to help in that .
